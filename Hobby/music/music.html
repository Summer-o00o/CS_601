            <h2>I started to learn piano when I was about 6 years old. I guess because of that, I have been in love with music for so many years. Even though I stopped learning it long time ago, every time I heard some good songs or music, I download the scores and try to play them with piano. Beside, I also like pop music, rap music, light music and so on. </h2>
