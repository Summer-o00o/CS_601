                    <p>
                        Qingdao has a temperate, four-season, monsoon-influenced climate that lies in the transition
                        between the humid subtropical and humid continental regimes. Winters range from cool to cold and
                        windy, but are generally dry, with a January average of −0.2 °C (31.6 °F). Summer is generally
                        hot and humid, but very hot days are rare, with an August average of 25.4 °C (77.7 °F)

                    <p>
                        There are a large number of German-style buildings in Qingdao's city center, a remarkable fact
                        considering the German leased-territory period only lasted 16 years (1898-1914). The unique
                        combination of German and Chinese architecture therein, combined with German demographic roots
                        and a large Korean expatriate population, gives Qingdao a rather distinct atmosphere.

                        First held in 1991 to celebrate the town's hundredth anniversary, festivals feature artistic

                        performances, various brewery beer tents, trade exhibitions, gala performances, carnival
                        amusement park games and rides, and even bikini model contests.

                        During the 2008 Summer Olympics, Qingdao and Beijing co-hosted the Olympic Sailing competitions.
                        In Qingdao, the events took place along the shoreline by the city. These events were hosted at
                        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingdao_International_Sailing_Centre"
                            target="_blank">Qingdao International Sailing Centre</a> and held in Fushan Bay, near the
                        city's central business district. An international broadcasting center and purpose-built hotel
                        were constructed for the Games.

                    <p>
                        Here is a fantastic video of Qingdao from Youtube! The author studied in Qingdao before and
                        visited it again in 2019 and made this video. Here is his impression about Qingdao:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote id="qingdao-youtuber" cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmEbUmgeZ1E">
                        <p>
                            Qingdao is perhaps the most beautiful coastal city in China, and boasts some spectacular
                            beaches, historic European architecture, pleasant weather, and delicious seafood.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The scenic beaches and rolling green hills and mountains are some of the highlights of
                            Qingdao, and are visibly stunning. The city, however, is also a major industrial and
                            commercial hub, with a massive port, connected via the 25.9 kilometer long Jiaozhou Bay
                            Bridge, one of the largest in the world.
                        </p>
