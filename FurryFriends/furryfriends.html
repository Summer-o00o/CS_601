                My cat Puss, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Shorthair" target="_blank">British
                    Shorthair</a> cat, is 4 and half years old already. He likes to sit in the sunshine to clean his
                hair, or sitting in the cat tree to take a look of people and cars outsisde of the window. Every morning, he will jump on the bed and come to us purring.
            </p>
            <p class="puss-p">
                When he was young, the vet highly suspecious him having <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feline_infectious_peritonitis">Feline infectious peritonitis</a>, which is a heartbreaking disease and usually strikes kittens and is almost always fatal. Except in rare cases, wet <abbr title="Feline infectious peritonitis">FIP</abbr> is fatal within about five weeks of diagnosis. The dry form is equally deadly but affected cats may survive for a few months. Me and my husband took him to several doctors and did many examinations. There is no drug to treat <abbr title="Feline infectious peritonitis">FIP</abbr>, so the vet can only treat symptoms. It was like a miracle that he finally recovered. But he was timid and doesn't like most stangers or too many environmental changes from that time. But for me, he is and will always be the cutest guy in the world! 
            </p>
            <p class="puss-p">
                These days he has reached 14 pounds and sometimes he cannot "brake" when he is playing games. Both me and the vet think he needs to lose some
                weight<span>&#128580;</span>.

                Amber is a new member of our family a few months ago! She is a standard sized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldendoodle" target="_blank">GoldenDoodle</a> with cream wavy hair. She is only 6 months, still a puppy, and is <strong>REALLY</strong> energetic! 
            </p>
            <p>
                The most difficult part for me is to introduce Amber and Puss to each other. Amber always wants to play and Puss always feels scared and wants to hide because of the difference in their sizes and weight. To solve this issue, I even took an online class about training dogs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Is Amber cute? Does she look small? Don't be fooled by this photo since she has already been 46 pounds!
