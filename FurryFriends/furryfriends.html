                My cat Puss, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Shorthair" target="_blank">British
                    Shorthair</a> cat, is 4 and half years old already. He likes to sit in the sunshine to clean his
                hair, or sitting in the cat tree to take a look of people and cars outsisde of the window.
            </p>
            <p>
                These days he has reached 14 pounds and sometimes he cannot "brake" during his chasing
                <span>&#128580;</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Check this funny video of him, and <strong>BOTH</strong> me and the vet think he needs to lose some
                weight.

                Is Amber cute? Does she look small? Don't be fooled by this photo since she has already been 46 pounds!

                Amber is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldendoodle" target="_blank">GoldenDoodle</a>. She is
                still a puppy, only 6 months, and she is <strong>REALLY</strong> energetic!
