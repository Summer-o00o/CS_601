                <p class="puss-p">
                    My cat Puss, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Shorthair" target="_blank">British
                        Shorthair</a> cat, is 4 and half years old already. He likes to sit in the sunshine to clean his
                    hair, or sit in the cat tree to take a look at people and cars outside of the window. Every
                    morning, he will jump on the bed and come to us purring.
                </p>
                <p class="puss-p">
                    When he was young, the vet highly suspected him having <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feline_infectious_peritonitis">Feline infectious
                        peritonitis</a>, which is a heartbreaking disease and usually strikes kittens and is almost
                    always fatal. Except in rare cases, wet <abbr title="Feline infectious peritonitis">FIP</abbr> is
                    fatal within about five weeks of diagnosis. The dry form is equally deadly but affected cats may
                    survive for a few months. Me and my husband took him to several doctors and did many examinations.
                    There is no drug to treat <abbr title="Feline infectious peritonitis">FIP</abbr>, so the vet can
                    only treat symptoms. It was like a miracle that he finally recovered. But he was timid and doesn't
                    like most strangers or too many environmental changes from that time on. But for me, he is and will
                    always be the cutest guy in the world!
                </p>
                <p class="puss-p">
                    These days he has reached 14 pounds and sometimes he cannot "brake" when he is playing games. Both
                    me and the vet think he needs to lose some
                    weight<span>&#128580;</span>.

            <article id="amber-article">
                <h3 class="titles">Amber</h3>
                <p>
                    Amber is a new member of our family from a few months ago! She is a standard size <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldendoodle" target="_blank">GoldenDoodle</a> with cream
                    wavy hair. She is only 6 months, still a puppy, and is <strong>REALLY</strong> energetic!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most difficult part for me is to introduce Amber and Puss to each other. Amber always wants to
                    play and Puss always feels scared and wants to hide because of the difference in their sizes and
                    weight. To solve this issue, I even took an online class about training dogs.
