                    <p>
                        Hi there, from here you will get to know a girl named Luyao Wang who is
                        originally from China, and has been in Oklahoma for 10 years! She got her Master's degree in Microbiology from University of Oklhoma, then started to work in Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation as a research technician.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This girl likes travelling, especially hiking and camping. She also enjoys
                        listening to the music, playing piano, photography, playing with her furry friends and sometime doing some handicrafts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is her first time to built a space that only belongs to her. Hopefully 
                        you will like it like she does! <span>&#128262;</span>
