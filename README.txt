HOMEWORK 1

Hi Josh,
Here is my README file that explains my project and effort I made to finish it.
First of all, I have to say that I have no experience with Web development. So basically HTML, CSS and JavaScript are all new to me. Before this class, the only class I took is CS300, so I can assume probably this area will be difficult for me and I need to spend more time with this class for sure (and try to get the "beyond the standard" credits).

So in this project, I made 6 pages for my webside, which includes index page, Hometown, Furryfriends, Hobbies, Experience and Contact.
For index page, I gave a short introduction of myself. A photo was embeded, and some emojis were used. I use <span> for the "Home" in menu bar, not for others. 
For Hometown page, one photo of my hometown was first embeded using <figure> with <figcaption>. I used <aside> and <ul> tags for the section names I represented, and I also added links so that when you press each one, it will link to a specific part of the same page. For each section, I add <hr> to better seperate them. In location part, you can press "Qingdao" and it will open a new window to show information about Qingdao from WIKI. A map was embeded using <iframe>. In culture part, I used <ul> and embeded a photo using <figure> and <img> with <figcaption>. In 2008 Olympic Games part, a link was added so that you can check more information of Qingdao International Sailing Center. In the last part, I use <blockquote> to quote the author's opinion and embeded a video from Youtube. For this part, at first the first video I tried to embeded can not shown on the website. I checked with validator but there is no error. Then I checked online and it seemed someone also have the same issue. I tried their method but it didn't work. However, when I use another video from Youtube, it worked. So I think probably it was the video's issue, or if you have any experience of that, please let me know.
For FurryFriends page, I used emojis, and embeded several photos. I also embeded a video using <video> tag, and with 2 types of video, one is mp4, the other one is webm. I also added 2 links to other sites.
For Hobbies page, I embeded several photoes with <figure> <imp> <figcaption>. I embeded a video using<video> and <source>. I added a link to other website for the handicrafts part.
For Experience part, I used <ol> to show the publications and added links to each publications. I used <table> to show the classes I have already taken or is being taken with <thead> <tbody> <tfooter>
For Contact part, I embeded a photo. And use <address> and <a> to add email link.



HOMEWORK 2

Hi Josh,
Here is my updated file for homework 2.
This time for html, I add 2 subpages and delete several items from the hobby page, probably next time will add some back.
For css, I would like to mention some highlights first. First of all, I downloaded 3 font family online and used them for the text decoration. Secondly, for Hometown page, I added an animation effect to the heading "Qingdao", and I also added a "back to top" button that when scroll down 100px from the web top, it will appear and stay at the bottom of the page. Next, for page "FurryFriends", I added an animation to images so that they can auto display. Here I encountered a problem and haven't solved yet. I wonder if you could give some advice. If the web page is opened in Safari, then the image transition is smooth and has a fading effect, but if I open it in Firefox, it doesn't have this effect. What's more, in page "Hobby", I added link to the button "Traveling" and "Photography" so that you can reach the subpages. In the traveling subpage, I added some effect to create a Polaroid look for the photo. In the photography subpage, I aligned the photos in 3 lines (please let me know if there is a better way to do this, I use 3 sections for 3 lines, so that first line can align at the bottom and last line can allign at the top) and when hovering to the image, it will enlarge.
For other things, I added some effect to the links, such as different colors before and after visit or hover on the link. Also for the media queries, when you shrink the window, the font size of the heading "Luyao's Sweet Home o_0" will become small and change color. The navigation bar will change to display in colume and even change to a "hangbeger icon" if the screen size is small enough. But it can not be pressed for now (after I learn JS, I should able to make it work). And the font size of "back to top" button will become small when screen shrinks and change to a arrow when the screen is small enough. Some headings' font-size will also change when screen size changes. The table is decorated.

I feel CSS is really difficult and time consuming. Basically it has too many things and I have to check almost every time when you need to use a new thing and still cannot remember it. 

Thank you for the help!
