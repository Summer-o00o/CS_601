Hi Josh,

Here is my README file that explains my project and effort I made to finish it.
First of all, I have to say that I have no experience with Web development. So basically HTML, CSS and JavaScript are all new to me. Before this class, the only class I took is CS300, so I can assume probably this area will be difficult for me and I need to spend more time with this class for sure (and try to get the "beyond the standard" credits).

So in this project, I made 6 pages for my webside, which includes index page, Hometown, Furryfriends, Hobbies, Experience and Contact.
For index page, I gave a short introduction of myself. A photo was embeded, and some emojis were used. I use <span> for the "Home" in menu bar, not for others. 
For Hometown page, one photo of my hometown was first embeded using <figure> with <figcaption>. I used <aside> and <ul> tags for the section names I represented, and I also added links so that when you press each one, it will link to a specific part of the same page. For each section, I add <hr> to better seperate them. In location part, you can press "Qingdao" and it will open a new window to show information about Qingdao from WIKI. A map was embeded using <iframe>. In culture part, I used <ul> and embeded a photo using <figure> and <img> with <figcaption>. In 2008 Olympic Games part, a link was added so that you can check more information of Qingdao International Sailing Center. In the last part, I use <blockquote> to quote the author's opinion and embeded a video from Youtube. For this part, at first the first video I tried to embeded can not shown on the website. I checked with validator but there is no error. Then I checked online and it seemed someone also have the same issue. I tried their method but it didn't work. However, when I use another video from Youtube, it worked. So I think probably it was the video's issue, or if you have any experience of that, please let me know.
For FurryFriends page, I used emojis, and embeded several photos. I also embeded a video using <video> tag, and with 2 types of video, one is mp4, the other one is webm. I also added 2 links to other sites.
For Hobbies page, I embeded several photoes with <figure> <imp> <figcaption>. I embeded a video using<video> and <source>. I added a link to other website for the handicrafts part.
For Experience part, I used <ol> to show the publications and added links to each publications. I used <table> to show the classes I have already taken or is being taken with <thead> <tbody> <tfooter>
For Contact part, I embeded a photo. And use <address> and <a> to add email link.
